## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- MVC architecture
- ES6 Modules
- ES6 Classes

### Dependencies

- core-js
- regenerator-runtime
- transformer-sass
- parcel

### Running locally

From the repo:

- Fork the repo
- Clone it via comman `git clone <URL of your forked repository>`
- cd `<forked repository directory>`
- Type `npm i` in your bash/command line
- Type `npm run build` in your bash/command line for production
- Type `npm start` to start your local development server

### What I learned

I got lot of confident in **MVC architecture** also, I am now much confortable with ES6 modules and classes. Abstracted each function into a module. Further, I want to co-relate MVC architecture with React library.
